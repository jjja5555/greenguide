          <h2 style = "color: grey">How to Prevent Pollution</h2>
          <p class = "large">There are infinite number of ways to prevent pollution. These are fews recommendations.</p>
          <h3>Throught Design</h3>
          <div style = "margin-left: 50px ">
            <p class = "large">By consider environmental issue into their design, your products and manufacturing systems can be made resource-efficient.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Through Process Changes</h3>
          <div style = "margin-left: 50px ">
            <p class = "large">Rethinking processes can create ways to reduce production waste, cutting both pollution and costs.  Processes can also be re-evaluated to determine if they are necessary to daily operations or can occur less frequently. For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p class = "large">Can machinery be adjusted to more efficiently utilize materials?</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">Does the oil need to be changed in all pieces of equipment at the same time even if it may be unnecessary?</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">Is it necessary to clean according to the current frequency or can the frequency of general facility cleaning be reduced?</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">Can small quantities of leftover paints of different colors be mixed and used for painting new surfaces?</p></li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h3>Through Materials Substitution</h3>
          <div style = "margin-left: 50px ">
            <p class = "large">Alternative materials for cleaning, coating, lubrication, and other processes can prevent costly hazardous waste generation, air emissions, and worker health risks. Before switching products consider the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p class = "large">Will the substitute work as well?</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">Will the substitute generate a different type of waste stream or release?</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">Will the substitute require purchasing additional equipment?</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">When looking for alternative products, coordinate through your purchasing department and develop policies that favor less toxic products when available.</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">Train staff on policies.</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">●	Remember that affordable does not necessarily mean less expensive.  Affordable can sometimes mean a higher initial price; consider the entire lifecycle of the product.</p></li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h3>Through Materials Reuse</h3>
          <div style = "margin-left: 50px ">
            <p class = "large">Find another way to reuse materials on-site. For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p class = "large">Distill used solvents.</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">Capture heat from discharge water or gases to be reused in another part of the manufacturing process.</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">Reuse cardboard boxes.</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">Reuse spent process water for pre-rinsing or apply non-hazardous water to land for irrigation (Note: Reuse permit is required.)</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">Substitute less hazardous chemicals for processes and cleaning to minimize contaminants in wastewater.</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">If materials cannot be reused on-site, look for off-site recycling opportunities.</p></li>
          </div>

          <h3>Through Waste Management</h3>
          <div style = "margin-left: 50px ">
            <p class = "large">The most effective way to manage waste is to minimize the amount of material that enters the waste stream. Minimizing waste at its source is called source reduction.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Through Resource Efficiency</h3>
          <div style = "margin-left: 50px ">
            <p class = "large">Using energy, water, and other production inputs more efficiently helps keep air and water clean, reduces emissions of greenhouse gases, cuts operating costs, and improves productivity.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p class = "large">Install low-flow fixtures on showers and sinks.</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">Purchase energy-efficient equipment; look for the <u>ENERGY STAR</u> logo.</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">Power down equipment when not in use.</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">Use power strips to prevent power loss when equipment is not in use.</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">Turn down water heater to 120 degrees Fahrenheit and insulate.</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">Adjust the heat and air conditioner down at night and during weekends and holidays.</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">Use vehicle fleets efficiently by driving the speed limit, checking the tire pressure regularly, mapping out trips, and turning off the engine when parked.</p></li>
              <li><p class = "large">Clean with a mop, broom, or vacuum instead of hosing down floors, walkways, and parking areas to conserve water and minimize contaminants in wastewater.</p></li>
            </ul>
