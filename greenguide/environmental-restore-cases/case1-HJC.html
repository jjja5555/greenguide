        <p class="large"> 
                In 2005, the public indicated that the green space of the Huaqing Jiauan Community did not meet the standard set by the government. Due to the lack of the government's administration, the green space of Huaqing Jiauan Community occupied only a tiny portion of the whole community area.
            </p>
            <p class="large">
                In the same year, lawyer Yueqin Chen and other non-governmental environmental group accused the Beijing Garden Bureau of not being responsible and signed the Reconciliation Agreement. The Agreement requested the Beijing Garden Bureau to investigate the green space in the Huaqing Jiauan Community, provide the investigation result certificate, and invite plaintiffs to witness these processes.
            </p> 
            <p class="large"> 
                As stated in the Reconciliation Agreement, the Beijing Garden Bureau performed all the requests and provided the “Green Space Investigation Certificate.” As a result, this case closed ultimately. But according to the "Green Space Investigation Certificate", the green space of the Huaqing Jiauan Community was only 16% of the total area. It was much less than 41%, the number promised by the developers of the community, and it was even below 30%, which was the government’s mandatory bottom line. 
            </p>
            <p class="large">
                Moreover, there are 3000 communities in addition to the Huaqing Jiauan Community that the government didn't perform a green space investigation. And due to lack of the government’s administration, the green space of these communities has been shrinking. But after this sucessful case, the Beijing Garden Bureau has fullfilled its role of administration by actively performing the green space investigation and ensuring that every community has achieved the government’s green space standard.
            </p> 
            <p class="large">
                This lack of action from the Beijing government regarding environment led to the first successful environmental lawsuit in China. Although the administration of the community's green space was just the first stage, which was different from the 30% green space ratio achievement, this case is an example of succesful cooperation between the government and the public towards greener community.
