        <p class ="large"> 
          Chi Mei Corporation is a plastic producer in Taiwan, Tainan. It was also the very first producer of acrylic in Taiwan back in 1960. In the beginning, Chi Mei Corporation was just one of the plastic producers, competing with other firms. However, until the recent earthquake and drought, Chi Mei Corporation stood out from the other producers and became an international plastic corporation.
        </p> 
        <p class="large">   
          Chi Mei Corporation was influenced by the growing trend of being an environmentally friendly corporation and pursued to be a greener company. As a result, Chi Mei Corporation improved its equipment to become more environmentally friendly.
          Some of the actions Chi Mei Corporation did to become an environment friendly company includes:
          <ol class="large">
            <li>Replaced the old equipment, increasing efficiency, and safety 
            </li> 
            <li>Replaced crude oil with natural gas which decreased the carbon emission by 17%
            </li>
            <li>Recycled and reused the water source for several times before discharging it. It reduced the overall water consumption by one third. 
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p class="large">
          Besides changing the internal equipment, Chi Mei also established an Energy Improvement Committee, requesting every department to join the pro environmental action movement and setting goals to create a more environmentally friendly company. 
        </p>
        <p class="large">
          Due to Chi Mei's endeavor to be an environmentally friendly company, it continued to run its production line despite the fact that other producers were forced to close their businesses because of the earthquake and the drought in Tainan. Since then, Chi Mei has boosted its customers’ trust and confidence toward their products and become an international plastic producer. Chi Mei Corporation is now thriving because it is an environmentally friendly company.
